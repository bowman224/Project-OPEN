projectOPEN SF

[www.projectopensf.org]

ProjectOPEN is a website that maps and displays open resources
in the city of San Francisco, in partnership with sfhomeless.net.

The site uses Google App Engine, the MediaWiki API, and the Google Maps
JavaScript API v3, to pull in and parse data on homeless resources and present
the resources in an interactive map.  Users can then create and print their
own custom maps with just the resources they are interested in.
